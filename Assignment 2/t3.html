    <p id="as">The history of computers dates back several decades. The first generation of computers was enormous, room-sized machines that used vacuum tubes. Over time, technology advanced, leading to the invention of transistors and integrated circuits that revolutionized computers, making them smaller and more efficient. Today, we possess computing power that could not have been imagined just a few decades ago, with devices that fit in the palm of our hands.</p>
    <p>The use of computers has also led to significant societal changes. They have transformed how information is shared and disseminated. Social media platforms, for instance, help people share ideas and revolutionize communication. However, itâ€™s essential to approach social media responsibly, as it can also lead to issues such as cyberbullying.</p>
